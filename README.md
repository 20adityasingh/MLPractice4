Population Data Analysis and Clustering
    This project performs an in-depth analysis of population data. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and finally, customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

üìä Dataset
    The analysis is based on the Population_Data.csv file. The dataset contains demographic information, including counts of different population groups.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The project is structured into the following key stages:

    Data Loading and Cleaning:

        The dataset is loaded using pandas.
        
        Numerical columns, initially stored as strings with commas (e.g., "1,234"), are cleaned by removing the commas and converting them to integer data types.
        
        Irrelevant columns such as Region and Office Location Id are dropped.

    Feature Engineering:
    
        Data inconsistencies were identified and corrected. For instance, the sum of Indian_Male and Indian_Female did not always match the Indians total.
        
        New features were created to capture these discrepancies:
        
        others: Represents the difference between the Total Population and the sum of all individual demographic groups.
        
        Foreigners_Other: Captures the difference between the Foreigners total and the sum of Foreigners_Male and Foreigners_Female.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    
        A correlation heatmap was generated using seaborn to visualize the relationships between different numerical features.
        
        Boxplots were used to identify the presence of outliers in the data distribution for each feature.
    
    Outlier Treatment:
    
        Outliers were handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
        
        Any data point falling below Q1‚àí1.5√óIQR or above Q3+1.5√óIQR was capped at the respective boundary. This reduces the impact of extreme values without removing data.
    
    Data Normalization:
    
        All features were scaled using sklearn.preprocessing.Normalizer to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the clustering model.

ü§ñ Clustering Model
    Algorithm: K-Means Clustering was used to segment the data into distinct groups.
    
    Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters (k): The Elbow Method was employed to determine the best value for k. By plotting the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) for a range of k values, we identified k=10 as the optimal number of clusters, as it represents the "elbow" point where the rate of decrease in inertia slows down.
    
    Model Training: The K-Means model was trained on the normalized data with n_clusters=10.
    
    Prediction: The model was used to predict the cluster for each data point, and the resulting cluster labels were added as a new cluster column to the dataframe.
